You all gather together in your usual spots: you sit in a chair closest to the television, and your parents sit on the couch. But when you turn on the TV, there's a crackling noise from the speakers. After some fiddling around, you all realize that they're broken. 

Still, you decide to watch anyway, using the built-in speakers on the TV. The show starts, but the built-in speakers just don't project at all. 

Your father groans and looks over at you. ",aware,explicit,,No,

Customers especially love the chocolate croissants, but the baker stops making new ones by noon, so these are often in short supply. 

One afternoon, a familiar-looking customer enters the store. Just as he approaches the counter, you both hear a shout from the back room: ""Hey, we're out of chocolate croissants!""
