One day, after classes get out, you walk together to get some coffee at a nearby coffee shop.
 
Before you sit down, Rob steps outside to take a phone call. While he's outside, you're surprised to see your mechanic at the coffee shop. He walks up and informs you that your car, which you recently took in for a tune-up, will be under repair for at least another week. You rely on that car, so this is very frustrating.
