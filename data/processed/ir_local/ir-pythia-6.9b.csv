Most of it is light, but some of the furniture is quite heavy. For the heavy stuff, you agree to help each other out. 

At one point, while Paul is still outside and you are carrying your mattress into your room, you suddenly feel a jolt of sharp pain in your back. You inadvertently gasp and clutch your back.
